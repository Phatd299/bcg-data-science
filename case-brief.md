# The brief from PowerCo

The Associate Director (AD) of the Data Science team held a team meeting to discuss the client brief. You’ll be working closely with Estelle Altazin, a senior data scientist on your team.

Here are the key takeaways from the meeting:

- Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
- The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
- PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
- This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

During the meeting your AD discussed some potential reasons for this churn, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?

So, now it’s time for you to investigate this hypothesis.
