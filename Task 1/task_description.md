# Your task - we need to understand PowerCo’s problem in detail

First things first, you and Estelle need to understand the problem that PowerCo is facing at a deeper level and plan how you’ll tackle it. If you recall the 5 steps in the Data Science methodology, this is called “business understanding & problem framing”.

Your AD wants you and Estelle to email him by COB today outlining:

- the data that we’ll need from the client, and
- the techniques we’ll use to investigate the issue.

Use the text field below to write your email, here’s what you’ll need to include:

- You must formulate PowerCo’s issue as a problem using the 5 step data science process and lay out the major steps needed to test it.
- What do you think are the key reasons for a customer deciding to stay with or switch energy providers? For example: price, is it clean energy, customer service, location etc.
- What data do you think would be useful in order to investigate these key reasons? E.g. customer purchasing trends over past 5 years, location of business etc.
- If you were to get this data, how could you analyse or visualize it to test whether these reasons may have an impact on churn?
