# Creating the new features
Estelle has done some further cleaning of the data and provided you with a new CSV file to complete our work from named “clean_data_after_eda.csv”. Be sure to use this data for your work on this task.

To help you understand her idea about the new feature to create, Estelle has also provided a starter notebook which will help you to create the feature she described. This notebook is called “feature_engineering.ipynb”. Use this as a template to start your feature engineering. 

We’ll show you some tips on the next step before you start your task, but make sure you have the relevant files downloaded before moving on!

- Download the new CSV data and Jupyter notebook
- Run the cells in the Jupyter notebook to create Estelle’s suggested feature
- We'll continue working in this Jupyter notebook to create some more columns, it's time to get creative!
