# Outline for making your predictions
It is your task to:

- Train a random forest classifier to predict churn
- Evaluate the predictions using evaluation metrics to demonstrate how accurately the model has performed

Estelle has provided a Jupyter notebook to get started. You should use this as a template to complete the work for this task.

Furthermore after the previous task of feature engineering, Estelle conducted a further review and has provided you with a final dataset to use this for this task, named “data_for_predictions.csv”. Be sure to use this dataset for this task.

You will notice that within the notebook, Estelle has imported various packages that would be used. One of them is named “scikit-learn”. This is an open source machine learning package and will be the source of the random forest model, as well as other things, that we use.

For more information on how to use the Random Forest classifier in scikit-learn, see the documentation site here

The outputs of your work will be shared with the AD and Estelle has given you a few points to include within the notebook:

- Why did you choose the evaluation metrics that you used? Please elaborate on your choices.
- Do you think that the model performance is satisfactory? Give justification for your answer.
- Make sure that your work is presented clearly with comments and explanations

When you are happy with your notebook, you should submit the notebook below. We'll show you an example answer on the next step!
