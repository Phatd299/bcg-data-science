# Letâ€™s get familiar with the data
As a Data Scientist at BCG, there will be occasions when you need to analyse data or investigate an issue and you are not provided strict instructions or guidance. You may be thinking, where do I start?

It is a highly valuable skill to begin to learn how to investigate a problem independently. A great way to learn this skill is to build a framework for analysis that works for you.

In this step, you'll need to analyse client data sets using Python and upload your work as a Jupyter notebook. We'll show you an example answer on the next step, but we encourage you to give it a go first!


The client has sent over 3 data sets (shown below):

- Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
- Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc
- Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not

You need to analyze the following using Python:

- The data types of each column
- Descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Distributions of columns
